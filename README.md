# Shift App

This is a web app developed for a network security course that required me to create an application with that implemented some forms of network/cyber security.
Created a ReactJS web app that allows users of a company to input shifts that they want to swap with other employees (then managers can confirm the requests). Application features login authentication, data encryption, user permission roles, and several other key features needed for a secure web application.
